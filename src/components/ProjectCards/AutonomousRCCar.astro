    <p>
      This autonomous RC car project was created during my freshman year at
      Lone Star Collegeâ€“Montgomery while I was an active member of the
      Engineering Society. The car is powered by a Raspberry Pi equipped with
      a camera running DonkeyCar. After approximately one hour of training,
      it can autonomously follow a track.
      <br /><br />
      The chassis was 3D printed and assembled at the Engineering Society,
      showcasing how rapid prototyping and machine learning can be combined
      to create a self-driving RC car.
